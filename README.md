Hello World!

I'm Andrew Thompson, or as my profile say's, my alias Gridox. I'm a technology enthusiast with a passion for cloud administration & automation.
Some of my interests are in music (Daft punk is one of my favorite groups!), video games, & philosophy.  
Currently working towards the CCNA certification & studying cloud computing fundamentals. Additionally, in the future I will be creating projects through github,
specifically using Python to create automation scripts. I'm looking to learn more about software development, so if anyone is interested in starting a project,
especially in regards to automation, let me know!

If you want to discuss technology or have a project that you think I could help with, You can reach me at my email: ad_thompson96@yahoo.com
